# Hierarchical-Truss-Structures
This Matlab program creates heterogeneous non-periodic truss using volume minimization with (global) stability constraints. A rod with desired stiffness and critical load could be implemented with an optimized truss with equivalent mechanical properties while using less material. Eulerâ€™s critical problem is transformed into the global buckling problem of the truss at the lower level of hierarchy. The recursive algorithm constructs and simultaneously searches the best structure of multi-level hierarchy. 

## Feature
input: 

E: Young's Modulus of the constituent material

w: even integer, topology parameter for Model_Beta

minA: minimum cross-sectional area of bar

L: length of the fusiform truss

F: uniaxial compressive load (required critical load)

k: required (effective) stiffness for the optimal truss 

hier: maximum hierarchy

output: the truss structure

## Quick start
1. Download ZIP and add all folders to Matlab path.

2. Run optTest.m. Matlab may take a long time to initialize parallel computing.

3. Run drawTest.m to visualize the results.
